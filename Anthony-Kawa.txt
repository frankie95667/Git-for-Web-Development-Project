Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        - block elements take up the full width and will always start on a new line

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        The element's position will not follow the rules of the parent and the location will be 
        relational to the window.

        you can use max-width

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        the box model is referring to design and layout and consists of boxes wrapped around 
        each element, representing position, margin, border, padding, and then content, which is the parent element.

        to fix the problem you can use the following css rule

        *, *:before, *:after {
            -moz-box-sizing: border-box; 
            -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; 
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
